# 2 Players Six Card Golf (home version)

This version of Six card golf is the one we play at home. It's different from the ones I found online, so I'll put the rules here

## Rules

### Goal
Have the lowest score after 9 rounds

### Board setup
Each player receives 6 cards face down, all cards left are put in a draw pile. Take the top card of the draw pile and put it in a discard pile, face up.

Each player needs to turn one card face up before starting to play, the one that won the previous round will start the round. If there's not previous round, it's randomly chosen.

### Turn actions
The players have 3 choice of action each turn
- Turning up a face down card on their side, the turn then ends
- Drawing a card: from the discard pile (only the last one) or from the draw pile.

If they chose to draw a card, they can replace any card on their side with the one drawn. They can also choose not to use it, and can simply put it in the discard pile.

The turn now ends, and the next player can start.

The game ends the turn after a player turned face up all their cards. (The other player can do one last turn, and then needs to turn all their cards face up)

### Scoring
- Jokers are worth -5
- Any pairs of cards is worth 0 points
- Kings are worth 0 points
- Every other card is worth their rank
